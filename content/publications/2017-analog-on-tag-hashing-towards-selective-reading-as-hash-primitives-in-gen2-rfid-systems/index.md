## Abstract

Deployment of billions of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID tags has drawn much of the attention of the
research community because of the performance gaps of current systems. In particular, hash-enabled protocol
(HEP) is one of the most thoroughly studied topics in the past decade. HEPs are designed for a wide spectrum
of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to collect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag
contains a hash function, such that a tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit
presence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never been implemented in COTS tags
in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year untouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog
on-tag hash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which moves prior HEPs forward
from theory to practice. In particular, we design three types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash
table function and tash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective reading,
which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2 protocol, without any hardware
modification and fabrication. We further apply our hash primitives in two typical HEP applications (i.e.,
cardinality estimation and missing detection) to show the feasibility and effectiveness of Tash. Results from
our prototype, which is composed of one ImpinJ reader and 3,000 Alien tags, demonstrate that the new design
lowers 60% of the communication overhead in the air. The tash operator can additionally introduce an overhead
drop of 29.7%.
